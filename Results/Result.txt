The best substitute method is the median since it prevents outliers and maintains the center tendency.So, Replace the NA values of Mileage, Engine and Power with median
Change the Seat NA valuesÂ to Mode. Despite being a quantitative value, the number of seats is discontinuous, hence the mode is employed.
It is preferable to remove a column in the instance of Newprice since there are a lot of null values there. Imputing any values could generate outliers in the data and incorrect analysis.
